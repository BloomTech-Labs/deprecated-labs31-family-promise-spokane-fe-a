## Executive Director Dashboard

- See pngs Dash1-Dash5 for design.
- Design is fully responsive using html, CSS, Grids, and ReactJS. 
- We were not able to implement Ant Design, which must be researched further.
- You must add react-plotly and remove react-vis to connect to the visualizations.
- Login page needs to be directed to the dashboard.
- FE deployment (https://a.familypromisesofspokane.dev/login)
